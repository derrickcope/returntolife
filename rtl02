INTRODUCTION

MORTAL perfection is achievable only through bodily perfection;
and therefore the development of physique to high levels of strength
and beauty, under control of the mind. This is the first requisite of
human achievement. Also the maintenance of a superior standard
of physical fitness is increasingly necessary to the maintenance of life
and liberty in any complex civilization. It is supremely so in times of
social strife. Therefore, the discovery and use of the most efficient
programs of physical improvement are now vital to the very preserva-
tion of the race.
In my judgment, Contrology is an ideal system to transform the body
into a perfect instrument of the will. It is kinesiologically proper,
physiologically sound, psychologically correct. I have personal knowl-
edge of its success in effecting astonishing results, not only for normal
adults but also for those suffering from supposedly incurable physical
defects and organic deficiencies.
For twenty years I have studied professionally the leading systems
of body development proposed and used in schools, colleges, private
gymnasia, and other institutions, and have no hesitation in saying that
the Pilates system is not merely 20 or 50 or 80 per cent more efficient,
but must be several times as effective as any practicable combination
of other systems.
To appreciate the truth of this statement the reader must himself
have experimented with other systems, and then must have actually
used Contrology. For it develops not only the muscles of the body,
suppleness of the limbs, and functioning of vital organs and endocrine
glands; it also clarifies the mind and develops the will.
So it is with great pleasure that I endorse Joseph H. Pilates' work,
and hope it will spread throughout our country, bringing increased
physical fitness to all.
