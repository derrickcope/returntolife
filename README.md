##"Return to Life" Open Source Project  

The 1945 book "Return to Life" is one of the few writings left us by Joesph Pilates and something that should be read by every Pilates instructor. Even though the copyright on this work is long expired I have had trouble finding a free copy online to recommend to my students. Another example of our community heritage being held hostage by corporations and private interests.  
Now that Pilates has become a worldwide phenomenon, Pilates instructors around the world should be required to read this explanation of what "Uncle Joe" called Contrology. Unfortunately, because there has not been a portable electronic edition (portable as in cross platform) readily available, the book has not been translated into many languages. Well now there is.  
I have put each page into a separate .txt file that can be easily downloaded, manipulated and translated.
